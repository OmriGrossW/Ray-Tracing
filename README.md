# Ray-Tracing

Ray Tracing - 3D scene drawing technique implemented to draw a scene described in a txt file by coordinates (surfaces and spheres).

Considering lighting geometrey, material, shadows, reflections, viewing and lighting angles, different light types etc.

Input file - txt file describing the scene to be drawn, each line is an object, first prompted by name (light, plane, spher) and each has it's own properties. (for light, position color and light type - for spher \ plane position and size and also color coefficients) there is an option to nake a plane a mirror plane by adding the letter 'M' at the end of the line describing the object.
